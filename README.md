# Stardust
Stardust is a lightweight web application framework. I made Stardust to serve as a bootstrap application for my future web apps. Stardust gives my apps a minimal build environment, some common UI elements, and a small library of JavaScript functions.

## How to build a Stardust app
These notes are mostly for me.

Install dev dependencies:
 - Needs NodeJS > 14.0
 - `npm install`

Build Stardust:
 - Run a one-time build: `npm run build`
 - Build and watch: `npm run build-watch`
